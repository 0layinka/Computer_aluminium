To create a visually appealing website for your contractor business **"Computer Aluminium and Building Services Ltd."**, we‚Äôll focus on design elements like **colors, fonts**, and other key features that align with your logo and industry.

### üé® **Color Palette**
Your logo already combines black/gray, white, and a goldish-brown color. Let‚Äôs build a balanced color scheme:

1. **Primary Color**: **Gold-Brown** (#B28734)
   - Use for buttons, headings, and icons.
2. **Secondary Color**: **Dark Gray/Black** (#333333)
   - Use for text and darker backgrounds.
3. **Accent Color**: **White** (#FFFFFF)
   - For clean spaces, text contrast, and backgrounds.
4. **Light Gray**: **#F2F2F2**
   - Use for subtle background areas (e.g., footer, cards).

### üî† **Fonts**
We want a professional and clean font style. Here are suggestions:

1. **Headings** (Strong & Professional): 
   - **Montserrat Bold** or **Poppins Bold**
   - These fonts are clean, modern, and add a premium feel.
2. **Body Text** (Readable & Simple): 
   - **Roboto Regular** or **Open Sans** 
   - Perfect for paragraphs and long descriptions.

**Font Pair Example**:
- Heading: **Montserrat Bold**
- Body: **Roboto Regular**
